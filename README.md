## üîÑ Recent Updates (v1.1.0)

### New Features

- **Unified Log Enrichment:**  
  Every log message is now enriched with a unique LogId (GUID), timestamp, ApplicationId, InstanceId, CloudProvider, Region, and any additional metadata. All of this information is embedded directly in the JSON payload.
  
- **Dual Metadata Transmission:**  
  The enriched JSON payload is sent along with a separate LogId parameter. This allows for:
  - **Efficient Routing & Partitioning:** The separate LogId is used as a partition key (or similar) by the queue implementations.
  - **Simplified Tracing:** Console or debug logs show the LogId immediately without needing to re-parse the JSON.
  
- **Resilient Queue Sending:**  
  With the use of Polly, transient failures are automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. This resiliency is applied transparently to the selected queue implementation when enabled.

---

### Breaking Changes (v1.1.0)

1. **Consolidation of Queue Interfaces:**
   - **Removed:** The old `IQueue` interface (which defined `SendMessageAsync(string, Guid)`).
   - **Now Using:** The new `ISendMessage` interface which defines:
     ```csharp
     Task<bool> SendMessageAsync(string payload, string logId);
     ```
     *All queue implementations have been updated to use this new signature.*

2. **Log Message Enrichment:**
   - The logger now generates a unique `LogId` once per log entry. This ID is embedded within the JSON payload along with metadata (timestamp, ApplicationId, etc.) and is also passed as a separate parameter.
   - This change means that downstream systems will receive a self-contained JSON log that includes the LogId, but the queue sender can also use the separate LogId for routing/partitioning purposes.

3. **Dependency Injection Changes:**
   - The logging pipeline now expects an implementation of `ISendMessage` instead of `IQueue`. If you have custom implementations that previously implemented `IQueue`, these must be updated or replaced with the new `ISendMessage`-based implementation.

4. **Version Bump:**
   - The library version has been changed from **1.0.17** to **1.1.0** to reflect these major breaking changes.

---

### How to Upgrade

- **Update Your DI Registrations:**  
  If you previously registered your queue implementations using the `IQueue` interface, change them to register as `ISendMessage`. For example:
  
  ```csharp
  // Old registration:
  services.AddTransient<IQueue, AzureServiceBusQueue>();

  // New registration:
  services.AddTransient<ISendMessage, AzureServiceBusQueue>();
  ```
  
  Additionally, if you're using the resilient decorator, update it accordingly:

  ```csharp
  // Using Scrutor for decoration (if enabled)
  services.Decorate<ISendMessage, ResilientQueueClient>();
  ```

- **Update Logging Method Calls:**  
  All log messages must now be enriched by the logger to include the LogId and other metadata inside the JSON payload. The logger then calls:
  
  ```csharp
  await _queue.SendMessageAsync(formattedLog, logId);
  ```
  
  Update your custom logging code accordingly if you're interfacing directly with these methods.

---

### Example Usage

Below is an example of how the updated logger now works:

```csharp
private async Task<bool> SendLog(object logEntry)
{
    // Generate a unique LogId once per log entry.
    string logId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    
    var enrichedLogEntry = new
    {
        LogId = logId,
        TimestampUtc = DateTime.UtcNow,
        ApplicationId = ApplicationMetadata.ApplicationId,
        InstanceId = ApplicationMetadata.InstanceId,
        CloudProvider = ApplicationMetadata.CloudProvider,
        Region = ApplicationMetadata.Region,
        LogData = logEntry
    };

    string formattedLog = _jsonConverter.ConvertMessageToJson(enrichedLogEntry);

    _logger.LogInformation($"Log with ID {logId} sent to queue.");

    // Send the enriched log payload with the LogId passed separately.
    return await _queue.SendMessageAsync(formattedLog, logId);
}
```

---

### Summary

These breaking changes and enhancements make the logging solution more robust, self-contained, and easier to trace and process downstream. We recommend upgrading to version **1.1.0** to take advantage of these improvements.

  Decouples log generation from delivery, enhancing resilience and scalability via the CerbIQ routing component.

- **Telemetry & Analytics:**  
  Built-in support for telemetry providers (OpenTelemetry, Azure App Insights, AWS CloudWatch, etc.) for end-to-end observability.

---

## Features

- **Developer Modes:**  
  - **EnableDevModeMinimal():** Minimal console logging without metadata injection‚Äîperfect for lightweight development debugging.  
  - **EnableDeveloperModeWithoutTelemetry():** Console logging with metadata injection but no telemetry data.  
  - **EnableDeveloperModeWithTelemetry():** Full-fledged logging with metadata, telemetry, and governance checks.  
  - **EnableBenchmarkMode():** A silent mode disabling all outputs, enrichers, and telemetry, ideal for performance measurement.

- **Governance Enforcement:**  
  Use built-in or externally provided validators (via the CerbiStream.GovernanceAnalyzer or custom hooks) to enforce required log fields and format consistency.

- **Encryption Options:**  
  Configure encryption modes to secure log data with options for None, Base64, or AES encryption.

  Route logs through configured messaging queues first for enhanced fault tolerance and delayed sink processing via CerbIQ.

- **Telemetry Integration:**  
  Out-of-the-box support for major telemetry platforms ensures your log data is immediately useful for observability and diagnostics.

## Architecture & Implementation

CerbiStream‚Äôs architecture is designed to maximize logging performance while ensuring compliance and structured data integrity:

- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  The logging pipeline is built using modern asynchronous patterns to avoid blocking I/O. This allows high-volume log generation without impacting application performance.

- **Queue-First Model:**  
  Log events are first enqueued (supporting various messaging systems) before being dispatched to the final sink. This decoupling reduces processing spikes and improves reliability.

- **Modular & Configurable:**  
  The framework uses a fluent API for configuration, letting you easily switch modes, enable encryption, set up telemetry, and plug in custom governance validators.

- **Governance & Validation:**  
  A key aspect of CerbiStream is its governance engine, which enforces structured logging policies. Whether integrated via CerbiStream.GovernanceAnalyzer or custom logic, it ensures that all log messages meet your organizational standards.

- **Performance Modes:**  
  Different preset modes (Benchmark, Developer Modes) allow you to choose the level of output and enrichment based on your environment‚Äîfrom raw performance testing to full-featured dev logging.

## File Fallback Logging with Encrypted Rotation

CerbiStream can automatically fallback to a local file logger if upstream log delivery fails. You can configure size/age-based rotation with optional AES encryption for compliance.

### Enable Fallback in Your Program.cs or Startup.cs

```csharp
builder.Logging.AddCerbiStream(options =>
{
    options.EnableDevModeMinimal(); // Or Prod/Custom config

    options.FileFallback = new FileFallbackOptions
    {
        Enable = true,
        PrimaryFilePath = "logs/primary.json",
        FallbackFilePath = "logs/fallback.json",
        RetryCount = 3,
        RetryDelay = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250),
        MaxFileSizeBytes = 5 * 1024 * 1024, // Rotate at 5MB
        MaxFileAge = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10), // Or age-based
        EncryptionKey = "your-32-char-AES-key-here!!",
        EncryptionIV = "your-16byte-iv"
    };
});
```

## Add Background Rotation Service ##

Make sure to register the rotation background service if you're using fallback:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHostedService<EncryptedFileRotationService>();
```
