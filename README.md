## Overview

**CerbiStream** is a high-performance, dev-friendly logging framework for .NET that not only emphasizes low latency and high throughput but also enforces structured logging governance. Designed for modern applications using `ILogger<T>`, CerbiStream integrates seamlessly into ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and Entity Framework projects. Its flexible configuration options and robust governance support make it ideal for both development and enterprise-scale deployments.

CerbiStream is a core component of the **Cerbi Suite**‚Äîa set of tools designed for observability, log governance, routing, and telemetry in regulated and performance-critical environments.

---

## Highlights

- **Dev-Friendly & Flexible:**  
  Works out of the box with .NET Core‚Äôs logging abstractions.

- **High Performance:**  
  Engineered for low latency and high throughput with efficient resource usage even when logs are output in realistic development modes.

- **Governance-Enforced Logging:**  
  Ensures logs conform to structured formats and compliance requirements via internal or pluggable governance validators.

- **Multiple Integration Options:**  
  Supports RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus, AWS SQS/Kinesis, and Google Pub/Sub.

- **Encryption & Security:**  
  Offers flexible encryption modes‚Äîincluding Base64 and AES‚Äîto secure sensitive logging data.

- **Queue-First Architecture:**  
  Decouples log generation from delivery, enhancing resilience and scalability via the CerbIQ routing component.

- **Telemetry & Analytics:**  
  Built-in support for telemetry providers (OpenTelemetry, Azure App Insights, AWS CloudWatch, etc.) for end-to-end observability.

---

## Features

- **Developer Modes:**  
  - **EnableDevModeMinimal():** Minimal console logging without metadata injection‚Äîperfect for lightweight development debugging.  
  - **EnableDeveloperModeWithoutTelemetry():** Console logging with metadata injection but no telemetry data.  
  - **EnableDeveloperModeWithTelemetry():** Full-fledged logging with metadata, telemetry, and governance checks.  
  - **EnableBenchmarkMode():** A silent mode disabling all outputs, enrichers, and telemetry, ideal for performance measurement.

- **Governance Enforcement:**  
  Use built-in or externally provided validators (via the CerbiStream.GovernanceAnalyzer or custom hooks) to enforce required log fields and format consistency.

- **Encryption Options:**  
  Configure encryption modes to secure log data with options for None, Base64, or AES encryption.

- **Queue-First, Sink-Agnostic Logging:**  
  Route logs through configured messaging queues first for enhanced fault tolerance and delayed sink processing via CerbIQ.

- **Telemetry Integration:**  
  Out-of-the-box support for major telemetry platforms ensures your log data is immediately useful for observability and diagnostics.

## Architecture & Implementation

CerbiStream‚Äôs architecture is designed to maximize logging performance while ensuring compliance and structured data integrity:

- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  The logging pipeline is built using modern asynchronous patterns to avoid blocking I/O. This allows high-volume log generation without impacting application performance.

- **Queue-First Model:**  
  Log events are first enqueued (supporting various messaging systems) before being dispatched to the final sink. This decoupling reduces processing spikes and improves reliability.

- **Modular & Configurable:**  
  The framework uses a fluent API for configuration, letting you easily switch modes, enable encryption, set up telemetry, and plug in custom governance validators.

- **Governance & Validation:**  
  A key aspect of CerbiStream is its governance engine, which enforces structured logging policies. Whether integrated via CerbiStream.GovernanceAnalyzer or custom logic, it ensures that all log messages meet your organizational standards.

- **Performance Modes:**  
  Different preset modes (Benchmark, Developer Modes) allow you to choose the level of output and enrichment based on your environment‚Äîfrom raw performance testing to full-featured dev logging.

## Usage Examples

**Basic Example**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Logging.AddCerbiStream(options =>
{
    options.EnableDevModeMinimal();
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

## File Fallback Logging with Encrypted Rotation

CerbiStream can automatically fallback to a local file logger if upstream log delivery fails. You can configure size/age-based rotation with optional AES encryption for compliance.

### Enable Fallback in Your Program.cs or Startup.cs

```csharp
builder.Logging.AddCerbiStream(options =>
{
    options.EnableDevModeMinimal(); // Or Prod/Custom config

    options.FileFallback = new FileFallbackOptions
    {
        Enable = true,
        PrimaryFilePath = "logs/primary.json",
        FallbackFilePath = "logs/fallback.json",
        RetryCount = 3,
        RetryDelay = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250),
        MaxFileSizeBytes = 5 * 1024 * 1024, // Rotate at 5MB
        MaxFileAge = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10), // Or age-based
        EncryptionKey = "your-32-char-AES-key-here!!",
        EncryptionIV = "your-16byte-iv"
    };
});
```

## Add Background Rotation Service ##

Make sure to register the rotation background service if you're using fallback:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHostedService<EncryptedFileRotationService>();
```
